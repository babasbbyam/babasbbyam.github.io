title: Quickstart for Jekyll
---

Jekyll is a simple, extendable, static site generator. You give it text written
in your favorite markup language and it churns through layouts to create a
static website. Throughout that process you can tweak how you want the site URLs
to look, what data gets displayed in the layout, and more.

## Instructions

1.Install a full [Ruby development environment](/docs/installation/)

2.Install Jekyll and [bundler](/docs/ruby-101/#bundler) [gems](/docs/ruby-101/#gems)

6.Now browse to [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000){:target="_blank"}

If you encounter any unexpected errors during the above, please refer to the
[troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/#configuration-problems) page or the
already-mentioned [requirements](/docs/installation/#requirements) page, as
you might be missing development headers or other prerequisites.
