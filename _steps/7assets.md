title: 7. Assets
---

Using CSS, JS, images and other assets is straightforward with Jekyll. Place
them in your site folder and theyâ€™ll copy across to the built site.

Jekyll sites often use this structure to keep assets organized:

![Asset](http://localhost:4000/assets/assetterminal.jpg)

## Sass

The inline styles used in `_includes/navigation.html` is not a best practice,
let's style the current page with a class instead.

![Sass](http://localhost:4000/assets/assetcss.jpg)

You could use a standard CSS file for styling, we're going to take it a step
further by using [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). Sass is a fantastic extension
to CSS baked right into Jekyll.

First create a Sass file at `/assets/css/styles.scss` with the following content:

![Stylecss](http://localhost:4000/assets/stylescss.jpg)

The empty front matter at the top tells Jekyll it needs to process the file. The
`@import "main"` tells Sass to look for a file called `main.scss` in the sass
directory (`_sass/` by default which is directly under root folder of your website).

At this stage you'll just have a main css file. For larger projects, this is a
great way to keep your CSS organized.

Create a Sass file at `/_sass/main.scss` with the following content:

![Maincss](http://localhost:4000/assets/mainscss.jpg)

You'll need to reference the stylesheet in your layout.

Open `_layouts/default.html` and add the stylesheet to the `<head>`:

![Default](http://localhost:4000/assets/defaultcss.jpg)

oad up <a href="http://localhost:4000" target="_blank" data-proofer-ignore>http://localhost:4000</a>
and check the active link in the navigation is green.

![Result](http://localhost:4000/assets/resultgreen.jpg)

Next we're looking at one of Jekyll's most popular features, blogging.
